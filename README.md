## Repo Explained

### [problems](/problems) directory:
- Contains questions and solutions specific to a language(C++, Java, Python).
- Each language directory contains a problem folder (Created by user) and has [`problem.md` or `problem.txt`] and [`solution.cpp`] inside it (for C++ as an example).
- Refer to an example: [power-of-four](/problems/cpp/power-of-four/)

### [data-structures](/data-structures) directory:
- Contains own implementaion of data structues such as Queue, Stack, HashMap,.. specific to a language.
- Refer to an example: [Queue-Data-Structure](./data-structures/Queue/myqueue.cpp).

### [algorithms](/algorithms) directory:
- Own implementation of algorithms. Such as finding prime, power...etc.
